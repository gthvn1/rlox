# Rlox â€” A Lox Interpreter in Rust

Rlox is an implementation of the Lox language (from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com)) written in Rust. It includes a command-line interpreter as well as a WebAssembly-based REPL that runs in the browser.

## Project Structure

This is a Cargo workspace with the following members:

- `rlox-interpreter`: Core Lox interpreter logic
- `rlox-web`: WebAssembly REPL for running Lox in the browser
- `rlox-server` (planned): Lightweight HTTP server in Rust using `tiny-http` or similar

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gthvn1/rlox.git
cd rlox
cargo build
cd rlox-web
wasm-pack build --target web
# This will generate pkg/ folder needed for the browser
python3 -m http.server
```

You should be able to open your browser at `http://localhost:8000`
