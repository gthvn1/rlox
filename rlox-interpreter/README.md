# RLOX: A Lox interpreter in Rust

- It is an implementation of [the Lox language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) in Rust.
- The goal is to generate some bytecodes (we don't know yet for which VM)
- But before let's write an interpreter for Lox expressions (not sure if we want to implement it for statements)
